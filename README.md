# Google Dictionary API

As google does not provide any API for google Dictionary.
This Self Project intends to create one.


## Getting Started

To use just pass the query string with parameter define equal to the word you want definition of.

Eg. **/?define=hello**, will give you definition of hello as provided by Google in JSON format.
