# Google Dictionary API

Google does not provide API for google Dictionary so I created one.

## Getting Started

To use just pass the query string with parameter define equal to the word you want meaning of.

Eg. **/?define=hello**, will give you definition of **hello**.


Optionally you can also send another parameter lang equal to code of the language in which the word appear.

Eg. **/?define=Bonjour&lang=fr**, will give you definition of **Bonjour** as present in French Dictionary.


List of languages supported can be found [here](https://googledictionaryapi.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/languageCode.txt) for your reference.

## Future plans
